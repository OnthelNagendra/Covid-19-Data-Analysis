This project performs an exploratory data analysis on the COVID-19 pandemic data for India. The analysis covers key metrics such as confirmed cases, deaths, and cures, and provides visualizations to highlight trends and key findings. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python.



##### Project Overview

The primary goal of this analysis is to:



Clean and preprocess the raw dataset to make it suitable for analysis.



Analyze and visualize the spread of COVID-19 in India.



Identify the states with the highest number of confirmed cases, deaths, and cured patients.



Explore trends over time for the pandemic's key metrics.



##### Dataset

The project uses the covid\_19\_india.csv dataset. This dataset contains daily records of COVID-19 cases, including:



Date of record



State/Union Territory



Number of Cured cases



Number of Deaths



Number of Confirmed cases



The data ranges from January 2020 to May 2021.



##### Technologies Used

Python: The core programming language.



Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and data visualization.



Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.



NumPy: For numerical operations.



Matplotlib \& Seaborn: For data visualization and plotting graphs.



datetime: For date and time manipulation.



##### Key Findings \& Visualizations

The analysis provides insights into:



The total number of confirmed, cured, and death cases in India.



The top 10 states with the highest number of confirmed cases.



Daily and cumulative trends of confirmed cases, deaths, and cured cases over the specified period.



The rate of new cases and deaths in different states.
